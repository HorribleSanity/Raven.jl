[Raven](https://github.com/HorribleSanity/Raven.jl)
is a toolbox for adapted discontinuous spectral element discretizations of
partial differential equations that supports execution on distributed manycore
devices (via
[KernelAbstractions](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/KernelAbstractions.jl) and
[MPI](https://github.com/JuliaParallel/MPI.jl)).

Some of our previous efforts in this area resulted in
[Canary](https://github.com/jkozdon/Canary.jl),
[Bennu](https://github.com/lcw/Bennu.jl), and
[Atum](https://github.com/mwarusz/Atum.jl).
